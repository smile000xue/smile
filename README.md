Starting from the winter vacation of 2022, I began self-studying the C programming language. At that time, I also discovered the powerful website GitHub and decided to post my code there.
During the summer vacation of 2023, I bought my first microcontroller, a 51 MCU with the chip STC89C52RC. It was designed by STC PRECHIN Inc. in China. I learned many projects from it:
1.Turning on the first LED
2.Controlling the LED status with a button
3.Communicating between a computer and a microcontroller via UART
4.Controlling the AT24C02 memory using I2C
5.Controlling the DS18B20 digital temperature sensor using One Wire
6.Analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion
7.Making an infrared remote controller
......

After completing my studies with the 51 MCU, I bought my second microcontroller, the STM32F103C8T6, manufactured by STMicroelectronics. 
It has more powerful functions and is programmed using a built-in function library.
1.LED flowing light
2.LED controlled by key
3.DC motor driven by PWM
4.Input capture mode to measure frequency
5.DMA data transfer
......

The third board I bought was an FPGA, with the chip ARTIX-7 XC7A35TFGG484-2 designed by Xilinx. It is programmed using the Verilog language and is significantly different from microcontrollers. 
The programming is done according to actual circuits. This way of programming shocked me and made me very interested in it.
1.4-bit counter
2.3-to-8 decoder
3.4-bit adder
4.UART_RS232
5.UART_RS232 state machine
6.UART_RS232_RXD controlling LED
